I'm going to attempt to create a strategy called the dual moving average crossover that will help me to determine when to 
buy and sell stock

## Startegy
The strategy is called the dual moving average crossover and it occurs when a short term average crosses a long term average. 
This signal is used to identify that the momentum is shifting in the direction of the short term average and a buy signal is 
generated when the short term average crosses the long term average and rises above it while a sell signal is triggered by a 
short term average crossing a long term average and falling below it
